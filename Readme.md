# Data Structures & Algorithms Fall 2023

## Overview of Projects:

- `Redis`, an in-memory key-value store. You can learn more about it here: [Redis in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1rOthIU-uo)

- `SQLite`, a relational SQL database where data is modelled as tables. `SQLite` is an `SQL` database represented as one single file. You can learn more about `SQL` here: [SQL Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjvFFKOm3c).
- `Neo4j`, a graph based database with a query language called `CypherQL`. These kinds of databases are useful in representing data in social media networks like Facebook. You can learn more about it here: [Neo4j in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6L9EoBy8Zk)
- `MongoDB`, a document based database which stores data as `BSON` objects. `BSON` is just a way to represent the human readable `JSON` as binary data. You can learn more about it here: [MongoDB in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=-bt_y4Loofg).
